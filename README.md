### Oh hello!

I'm a full-stack software engineer. Coding scratches the perfect spot on my brain, where problem-solving meets creativity. Since starting at App Academy I've found myself cheerfully dedicating evenings and weekends to work on projects. The rush of finally fixing the bug that has been plaguing you for hours is like nothing else.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on adding cool features to my a/A capstone project.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to land my first SWE job!
- 💬 Ask me about the decision to pivot the direction your life is going in.
- 📫 How to reach me: a.holahan7@yahoo.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her/hers
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been playing Overwatch on Xbox for the past 6 years and finally reached top 500 support a few months ago.

** If you are noticing the gap in my garden, it is due to my husband getting PCS orders and us having to move across the country (from NC to WA) -- not a fun drive! **
